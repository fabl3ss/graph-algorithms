# About
This **web application** is designed to work with algorithms for finding **shortest paths** in a graph.
The program also includes functions for working with binary trees.
The user can not only see the shortest path, but also its **route**.
The graph is **interactive**, that is, the user can zoom in, zoom out, or move the nodes.
